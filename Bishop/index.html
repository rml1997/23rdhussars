<h2>The Battle: a Tank Officer Remembers</h2>

<p>By <a href="../Men/Bishop_GSC_b_c.html">Geoffrey S.C. Bishop, MC</a>.</p>

<p>Published privately, this is Geoff's journal of his time in 23H from 14 Jun 1944 until 7 Aug 1944, the day C Squadron came down from the <a href="../Gallery/Fra/index.html#perrier">Perrier Ridge</a> in Normandy.</p>   

<p>Geoff was initially attached to the 270th Forward Delivery Squadron (FDS). They landed on the Normandy coast on 23 Jun - the bulk of 23H having gone over on D + 9 (15 Jun). Originally posted to B Squadron, he was transferred to C Squadron on 12 July and placed in command of 1st Troop.</p>

<p>Although his recollectiion of dates is occasionally hazy - understandable given the circumstances - nevertheless his book gives us a valuable insight into life at the sharp end of a tank regiment.</p> 

<p>He died in 1967 aged 58. Along with a disturbingly large number of his 23H comrades, he did not enjoy the long life which he surely deserved. I offer my thanks to him both as a soldier and chronicler - and as a man whom my Dad both knew and respected. Thanks Geoff.</p>
