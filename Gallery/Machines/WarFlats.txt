The 50-ton 'Warwell' wagons became necessary during the Second World War when US-built Sherman tanks were planned to be shipped to Britain and stored  pending Operation Overlord, the invasion of Europe (commonly known as D-Day). These tanks were too high to be carried on flat wagons in Britain because they would foul bridges and tunnels. Insufficient suitable well wagons were available, so the Ministry of Supply commissioned the 'Warwell' wagons.
 
 The bogies, screw jacks and OCEM buffers were the same as applied to the 'Warflat' wagons. Three manufacturers constructed these wagons; Gloucester Carriage & Wagon Co, Head Wrightson and Southern Railway. They were classified as private owner wagons and were registered as fit for traffic by the LMS, except the SR-built wagons which were registered by the SR themselves.
