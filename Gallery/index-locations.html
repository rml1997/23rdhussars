<h2>Image Gallery - Locations</h2>

<p>Here you will find a collection of maps, plans and photographs of every place visited by the Regiment, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Many of the French maps and plans shown here pre-date the war - some by a large margin. However, in remote rural areas such as the villages of Normandy - and others which escaped the ravages of WWI - the landscape had altered little over time (the coming of the railways being the main exception).</p>

<p>For the most part, the towns and villages depicted in these images were pretty much as the men of 23H would have found them - the condition they left them in, however, may have been rather different. But some survived intact; anyone who has visited <a href="Fra/index.html#beny">Le Beny Bocage</a>, for example, will notice that it looks very much the same today as it did on pre-war postcards - the reason being that the 23H played a large part in ejecting the German occupants with the minimum of resistance. Not surprisingly, this was rarely the case.</p>
<p>Apologies to my Scottish brethren (my maternal Grandfather was born in Glasgow) for listing Kirkudbright under England.</p>
