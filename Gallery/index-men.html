<h2>Image Gallery - Men</h2>

<p>Here you will find information about every man who wore the colours of the 23rd Hussars and whose identity could be discovered. Family details are given where known.</p>

<p>Sadly, some names are missing. Although address lists for A, B and HQ Squadrons were produced, I have never come across, or heard mention of, one for C Squadron. Survivors who could have filled the gaps are no longer with us. It is the price I must pay for starting this project far too late.</p>

<p>From the criminal underworld to the aristocracy and everything in between, the list includes, for example, Margot Fonteyn's brother; the designer of the Humber Bridge; the composer of the music for "A Bridge Too Far"; a lawyer at the Nuremberg Trials; a petty thief from London's docklands; and someone who helped design the toilet for the Space Shuttle (my Dad). All human life is here.
