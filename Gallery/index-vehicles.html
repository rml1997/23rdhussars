<h2>Image Gallery - Vehicles/Equipment</h2>

<p>Here you will find a collection of maps, plans and photographs of every place visited by the Regiment, both at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Many pre-date the war - some by a large margin. However, in remote rural areas such as the villages of Calvados in Normandy and others which escaped the ravages of WWI, the landscape had altered little over time (the coming of the railways being the main exception).</p>

<p>For the most part, the towns and villages depicted in these images were pretty much as the men of 23H would have found them - the condition they left them in, however, may have been rather different. But some survived intact; anyone who has visited Le Beny Bocage, for example, will notice that it looks very much the same today as it did on pre-war postcards - the reason being that the 23H played a large part in ejecting the German occupants with the minimum of resistance. Sadly, this was rarely the case.</p>
