<blockquote>
"In the driver's seat was Trooper <b>Sam English</b>, a tough and combative London bus-driver in his early thirties.
Sam was one of those soldiers with quite enough personality and authority to be promoted, but every time
he was given a stripe it ended in tears, usually because someone had emerged from a regimental dance with two black eyes after a disagreement with him. But he was a splendid loyal man with a caustic humour."

<blockquote>
"Through his periscope in the gunner's seat in the squadron leader's tank, <a href="Ward_A_c.html">'Oscar' Ward</a> saw tank after tank going up in front of him. 'Our turn next', he forecast. 
Surprised at receiving no instructions he looked up 
at his squadron leader above him in the turret. Bill was transfixed, speechless, frozen, in a horrified stare
at the appalling scenes ahead. Seconds later they were hit through the turret.<br /><br />
<a href="Shebbeare_WGC_b_c.html">Bill Shebbeare</a> and <a href="Horrobin_B_c.html">Bert Horrobin</a> were
both killed instantly and the tank burst into flames. <a href="McGrath_AJ_c.html">'Buttons' McGrath</a> flung
open his hatch to bail out and his revolver caught in the lip of the opening, holding him back. By now his hands and hair were burning in the intense heat. <b>Sam English</b> was also out and on fire; they both rolled in the grass. As they did so a flaming body fell from the turret, <a href="Ward_A_c.html">'Oscar' Ward</a>. He owed his life to the presence of 'Buttons' and Sam to put out the flames."
