<legend>Notes</legend>
<blockquote>
"On withdrawing from Hill 112 we had trouble with the tank engine and I was told to take it into the REME Workshops
in Bretteville to have it attended to. On reaching the main Caen-Bayeux road we were stopped at a road junction by
a military policeman with white blancoed equipment and white gauntlet gloves and informed that we could not proceed
further along the road as a VIP was due shortly. I ordered Harry to cut across country and we rejoined the road farther along. On reaching the next junction there was another similarly attired military policeman. He wanted to know how I was able to get to that point as the road was closed with a VIP coming 'within minutes'. I told Harry to pull the  tank onto the grass verge and we would 'brew up'. We had just got our mugs of tea, when down the road came a host of motor cycle outriders followed by a number of jeeps and an open car with 'Monty' and Winston Churchill in the rear seat. I just had time to transfer my mug to my left hand, call the crew to attention and give a salute.  
'Monty' returned the salute and Winston removed his cigar from his mouth with his left hand whilst giving us a V for victory sign with his right.  
<br /><br />
The workshops staff did not get on quickly with the job of correcting the fault, so on the 5th July I informed my 
crew that I was going to walk the few miles down the road to where the Regiment was harboured to seek the assistance 
of the Regimental Technical Officer to get the job completed. The Technical Officer drove me back to the workshops 
in his jeep where I found Harry and Ken in a state of shock. During my absence the Germans had shelled the workshops 
and 'Smokey' had been killed by one of the shells, which had fallen close by."<br /><br />
