<blockquote>
"On 6 August 1944, on the high ground at Le Bas Perrier, Sergeant Smith took over 4th Troop from the Troop Leader who had been killed. During the afternoon he was ordered to take his Troop forward to support the Infantry in Le Bas Perrier. Despite the fact that he was suffering from minor injuries and shock caused by a bomb landing next to his tank, Sergeant Smith took his Troop forward. On arriving at the Infantry position Sergeant Smith found his Troop reduced to two tanks. Despite this he went forward to locate a Tiger Tank that was menacing the Infantry. The other tank then broke down but Sergeant Smith continued. He manoeuvred into such a position as to prevent the Tiger coming forward and eventually compelled it to withdraw. Despite his being surrounded by the enemy and under continual fire, Sergeant Smith remained in position until ordered to return to his Squadron. He refused to do so until he was able to recover his other tank. This he did by dismounting from his own tank and under small arms fire attached a rope to this other vehicle in order to give it a tow to start."
