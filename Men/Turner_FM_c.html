<p>
<blockquote>
FM Turner was born 12 November 1922 and entered the School from Chilton
House, Rhos-on-Sea in 1933. He had a distinguished School career, being a
School Prefect, a Prefect of School House and Captain of the 1st XV. The
Birkonian reported 'Set his team a magnificent example; his speed and
determination were invaluable both in attack and defence.' He was awarded
1st XI Hockey colours and was Captain of Running as a Sprinter and Hurdler.
In addition he was in the Tennis VI, won a good boxer prize and obtained a
Wartime Certificate 'A' in the J.T.C. and was awarded the Field Cup (Ludis
et Moribus). On leaving School he was apprenticed to Lister & Co. of Dursley.
The War List records that he was killed in action in October 1944.<br /><br />

<blockquote>
"Stand-to and went up to the wood to see if the enemy were there and in a gap lay 3 R.B.s dead, including the ginger boy. They broke the rules - never go through an obvious gap - it will be covered. Frank must have gone too close. I could not believe he was gone. Funny. I lent him my best tie to go. Often think of Frank now. Came straight off leave into action - can't remember what we talked about but I'll ask him one day."<br /><br />
