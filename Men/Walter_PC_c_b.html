<blockquote>
"Some of my troop leaders were older than I was. The most impressive was Peter Walter, in normal life an actor...... He looked out upon the world with humour toughened but never made cynical by the repertory circuit, with a smiling. reassuring kindness and helpfulness. His high competence included - surprisingly for one of his profession - skill as a mechanic together with a willing readiness to get his hands dirty. I never once saw him lose his temper, always a smile whatever his physical discomfort."

<blockquote>
"Having sent the sole surviving troop back behind the railway, Peter now tried to do what he could for the wounded, administering morphine and fixing shell dressings. His task was not made any easier by a useless left hand, a burnt face and heavy shellfire, but so many were in a worse case that he ignored his own troubles."

"Peter Walter was awarded an immediate Distinguished Service Order. If the full story had been known at the time it should have been the Victoria Cross."
