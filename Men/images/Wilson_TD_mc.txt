Recommendation for the award of the Military Cross to Lt. T.D. Wilson

For the operation in the vicinity of Nieuport 28-30 May, 
I placed him in command of an improvised Light Tank Troop. 
He was constantly with his troop from about 1600 hrs. 28 May until nightfall 29 May 
and his handling of his troop played an important part in holding up the German advance 
during these critical hours. 

In addition he kept me well supplied with important information throughout the period he was in action. 

The infantry in the sub-sector from inclu[sive] Nieuport - the sea were constantly subjected to heavy S.A. 
[small arms] and mortar fire and Lt. Wilson displayed great enterprise and activity in locating and 
subduing M.G. [machine gun] posts. His activity was largely instrumental in checking the many attempts 
made by the Germans to cross the canal, particularly during the night 28-29. This was especially commendable 
as tanks work under considerable disadvantage in darkness. 

A source of some anxiety was the presence of enemy tanks just over an intact bridge in Nieuport and Lt. Wilson 
handled his light tanks (in fact, ineffective against these German tanks) in a manner which undoubtedly helped 
to deter the enemy tanks from advanding and when one of his tanks broke down he assisted, at great personal risk, 
in placing it to augment a road block already in position. 

From 1600 hrs. until nightfall 29 May he carried out some valuable reconnaissance and fine action in the Wulpen 
area during the initial time when the Germans were making great efforts to effect a crossing over the canal. 
His troop by this time was reduced to 1 light tank and 1 armoured car but these drew heavy artillery fire. 
This however, did not deter Lt. Wilson from maintaining his position in support of the infantry for 3 or 4 hours.

Signed. Brigadier [A.J. Clifton] 
Commanding 2nd Armoured Reconnaissance Brigade and Sector Nieuport-Wulpen in operations referred to.
