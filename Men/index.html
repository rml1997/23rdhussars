<h2>The Men</h2>

<h3>A-Z index</h3>

<p>Here you will find information about every 23H man whose identity could be traced. Brief family details are given where known.</p>

<p>Sadly, some names are missing. Although address lists for A, B and HQ Squadrons were produced, I have never come across, or heard mention of, one for C Squadron. Survivors who could have filled the gaps are no longer with us. It is the price I must pay for not starting this project sooner.</p>

<p>From the criminal underworld to the aristocracy and everything in between, the list includes, for example, 
<a href="Hookham_FEF_x.html">the brother</a> of Margot Fonteyn; <a href="Wew_B_c.html">the designer</a> of the Humber Bridge</a>; <a href="Addison_JM_c.html">the composer</a> of the music for "A Bridge Too Far"; <a href="Shaw_DF_a.html">an actor</a> who appeared in the film 'The Colditz Story'; <a href="DaCunha_JW_x.html">a lawyer</a> at the Nuremberg Trials; a petty thief from London's docklands. All human life is here....
</p>

<p>
....and death.
</p>

<h3>The Fallen</h3>

<p>The main sources of info about those who died in the service of 23H are:
<ol>
<li>The Commonwealth War Graves Commission website;</li>
<li>The graves themselves, scattered as they are throughout northwest Europe.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
and the Rolls of Honour (ROHs):
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>as listed in the 23H Story (Pages <a href="../Story/270.html">270</a> and <a href="../Story/271.html">271</a>);</li>
<li>as listed in <cite>"Taurus Pursuant, a history of 11th Armoured Division", Palamontain, 1945</cite>;</li> 
<li>carved on wooden panels and on permanent display in Bridlington Priory Church.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>However, the above do not provide the full picture. Some men were killed before 23H saw action in Europe (eg. during training); some lost their lives whilst attached to other units; at least one man is known to have committed suicide. They do not appear on any 23H ROH.</p>
<p>Neither does another man, Lt. <a href="Walker_AM_x.html">Alan Michael Walker MC</a>; I can find no reason for his exclusion.</p>
<p>Clerical errors do not help either. An extreme example is that of Trooper <a href="../Men/Cook_FJ_b.html">Frederick John Cook</a>, a tank driver in B Squadron. He is listed in the 23H Story (<a href="../Story/272.html">Page 272</a>) and 'Taurus Pursuant' as being KIA in Antwerp on 4 Sep 1944. Happily, this is not correct: he survived the war and lived until 1981.</p>
<p>I have applied the rule that: if a man had served in, or been attached to, the Regiment, for however short a period, and was killed either during the War, or soon after as a direct result of it, then he is included in the <a href="index-kia.html">All who died</a> list.</p>
<h3>Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>
Happily, only a handful of 23H men were taken prisoner and their incarceration was not to be for long. This section contains a list of those men, with details of their imprisonment and, in some cases, the circumstances of their capture.
