<h2>The Story of the Twenty-Third Hussars</h2>

<p>Here, reproduced in full, is the regimental history of the 23rd Hussars.</p>

<p>There has been some debate as to its authorship. In his books 'Operation Epsom' and 'Operation Goodwood', the late Ian Daglish stated that <a href=../Men/Bishop_GSC_c.html">Geoffrey Bishop</a> had been the author. He retracted that claim in his later book 'Operation Bluecoat' and instead attributed its authorship to <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">'Monkey' Blacker</a>.</p>   

<p>I don't propose to add to the conjecture. The book itself declares that it was "written and compiled by members of the Regiment" and "no fewer than five different authors have been involved" (<a href="009.html">Page 9</a>). I am content with that and grateful that they did such a fine job.</p>

<p>
I had the great pleasure in meeting Ian Daglish when he came to interview my Dad in 2011. His books on Operations EPSOM, GOODWOOD and BLUECOAT gave me a deeper insight into the battle for Normandy and the role played by 23H and I highly recommend them.</p>

<p>He was also instrumental in arranging a get-together in Le Beny Bocage, Normandy, in July 2011, to remember that first day of August 1944 when 23H liberated the village. It was a delight for me to be there and to meet members of the famlly of Sgt John Sear and local residents who were there at the time. Sadly, Ian himself could not make it.</p>

<p>On my return to England I was devastated to learn that Ian had been involved in an aircraft accident on the very day I was returning on the ferry and that he had died from his injuries two days later.</p>

<p>Recently my family discovered that Ian had graduated on the same day and was present at the same ceremony at Manchester University as my sister.
</p>

<p>I will always be grateful to Ian for his assistance - it was great to meet someone so enthusiastic about recording the history of the Normandy Campaign. He will be sadly missed.</p>
