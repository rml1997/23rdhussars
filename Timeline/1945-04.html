Whilst the Regiment/Battalion Group remained harboured at X roads, 1/100,000 Sheet P2,
"C" Squadron and H Company were ordered to 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#saerbeck">Saerbeck</a>, 9297 
to protect the Division flank and attempt to open up the main route.
They were however met by a heavily defended Flak position on the north east outskirts of the village 
and after much slaughter and destruction claimed eight 88mm guns and a number of 20mm Flak, 
about 50 killed and over 100 PWs at the end of the day, during which they did not lose one tank.

Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, had been the forward Observation Officer. The 23H Story states he was shot dead by a sniper, my Dad says he was killed by one of the German prisoners being brought in.<br /><br />
<blockquote>
The rest of the squadron were having a real slaughter as it seemed after surrender flags had been shown, some of the enemy opened fire and killed a well-liked Corporal of E Company. I heard the order to get the whole fire power on to the enemy. We were all shaken that day as Bill Budgeon of 13 RHA, a very brave chap, had been killed.<br />

During this time the 15th/19th Hussars Group had established a bridgehead across the Dortmund - Ems canal
and had pushed through a gorge across the ridge of the Teutobuger Wald. The 23rd Hussars/<acronym title="8th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade">8th RB</acronym> Group were 
ordered forward at 12.00 hours, led by "B" Squadron Group. Having passed over the canal we passed slowly up 
the wooded gorge north of

<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#tecklenburg">Tecklenburg</a>, 0502. The leading tank of "B" Squadron
was hit by a Bazooka as it reached the centre of the town, which lay in a hollow between two ridges and
consisted of very narrow,old-fashioned streets. Whilst "B" Squadron and F Company were trying to clear this
most unpleasant place, where even the civilian population seemed to be fighting, A1 Echelon was attacked by
machine gun and rifle fire in the gorge of the Teutobuger Wald, wounding both the Echelon Commander and the
Signals Officer. Towards evening an  attempt was made to work "C" Squadron Group round from the west but by 
nightfall 3rd <acronym title="Royal Tank Regiment">RTR</acronym>
 had managed to outflank the town from the east and had cut the main road to the north.

 Group in torrential rain, "C" Squadron Group leading. By daylight we
had reached T roads 086059. "C" Squadron Group branched due north to X roads 0809, 1/100,000 Sheet N2, where they 
turned east after some rapid and lively clearing of Bazooka positions on the railway line and at the X roads.
The rest of the Group, led by "A" Squadron, followed through
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#lotte">Lotte</a>, 1208 and passed over 3rd <acronym title="Royal Tank Regiment">RTR</acronym>
 bridgehead at 179129 at 11.00 hours,
turning east to T roads, 2011 and then north. At about 14.00 hours two leading tanks of "A" Squadron were hit by
88mm HE fire at T roads 2013. "B" Squadron Group were diverted over the bridge via T roads 182135 and 199143 to tackle this position from the north. After some heavy, steep going through road blocks etc, they passed through "A" Squadron and took on the lead with orders to rush the bridge over the Ems - Weser Canal in the area of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#herring">Herringhausen</a>, 3417. Starting at about 17.30 hours "B" Squadron Group led at full gallop across the high open stretch of ground north of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#osnabruck">Osnabruck</a> via T roads 220157 and X roads 257159. at this point "C" Squadron Group in the rear were diverted to the south to X roads 2712 to open up an alternative route to the objective. This developed into a great race as darkness fell, "B" Squadron on the northern and "C" Squadron on the southern road, both of them shooting up transport and men in passing. "B" Squadron on the shorter road won, and secured intact both bridges at 349175 and 356170. The Recce Troop meanwhile were recceing the three bridges to the north. hese bridges were mined but intact abd the enemy were engaged on the far bank. They were recalled when the crossings to the south had been gained. "B" Squadron Group spent the night in the bridgehead, the remainder harbouring at

Towards evening the enemy started the first of several air attacks, which continued during the next days, raising all kinds of antediluvian aircraft with very little opposition from the RAF. During one of these A Echelon was attacked some 10 miles to the rear and suffered casualties, 4 x Other ranks wounded and 1 x car 5-cwt 4x4 Willys destroyed by enemy action and 1 x car, a 5-seater Hudson and 1 x car, a 5-seater Mercedes/Benz (captured enemy vehicles) were abandoned owing to unserviceability and non-availability of spares.

After a close survey of the village two tanks were pushed forward, one on the road and the other to the left, both covered by the remaining two. After they had travelled some 50 yards down the forward slope, the Germans opened fire with 88s and 40mms. In addition small arms and bazooka fire came from the wood immediately to the south or right of the road where the rest of the vanguard was halted.

The tank on the road was hit twice by an 88. Fortunately, neither shot penetrated as the first hit the side bin, and the second hit the driver's periscope and was deflected into the gun mantlet. Both tanks immediately wheeled about and put down smoke, thickened up by that of the 2nd i/c's 95mm gun, and the two other supporting tanks. The entire troop pulled back the tanks down behind the crest and remained in observation, except for an occasional sally to draw fire, and to fire themselves. The German camouflage was, however, so good that no trace of the guns could be seen.

The Squadron leader and Company commander came up to look at the ground but a detailed recce could not be made owing to small arms fire from the wood. It was essential to clear this before anything else could be done, so the vanguard Motor Platoon with the support of 4th Troop on the right were ordered to clear it to a depth of 150 yards south of the road and 450 yards east towards

<acronym title="Forward Observation Officer">F.O.O.</acronym> came up to make a more detailed recce. The edge of the village could just be seen, but in between there was a further ridge some 700 yards short of

As speed was essential, and as to lay on a smoke programme would have taken some time, and in view of the complete absence of suspicious movement in 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#barum">Barum</a> it was decided to make a dash for the village. The plan was for 1st Troop to move flat out for the village on the right or south of the road, covered by 2nd Troop and Squadron HQ from the ridge. The 2nd Motor Platoon to move some 300 yards behind then down the road in their half-tracks, but not starting before the tanks were halfway to the village, and at the same time 4th Troop and the Platoon already on the ridge to move across and mop up the pill box area.

Whilst this was being tied up the <acronym title="Forward Observation Officer">F.O.O.</acronym> put down a heavy concentration of 25 pounder and medium artillery on the forward or west edge of the village. As soon as this concentration lifted,the 3 tanks of 1st Troop moved forward, but after travelling for some 250 yards all the hidden enemy guns opened up from the village. The pill box position also became active and small arms fire started from the woods to our rear. Two tanks of 1st Troop were hit several times, and both began to brew up. Smoke was put down by all covering tanks, and the third tank was able to pull round and reach the safety of the crest. The leading half-track had been hit by a 40mm and was also disabled. In addition, 4th Troop on the right were unable to get up to the demolished pill box as this entailed their going over the crest and exposing their flanks to the 88s. Smoke was called for from the 25 pounders in order to give a screen under which the de-horsed crews could get back. All these did return, and it was subsequently found that the speed of the tanks saved their lives as the German gunners did not allow enough aim off, and both tanks were hit in the engine compartments. The enemy maintained a rapid rate of fire, but this was eventually subdued by the 25 pounders, by fire from 2nd Troop in the copse, and 3rd Troop who were deployed on the left of the road behind the first crest. It was now obvious that a full scale attack would have to be made on the village involving all the Squadrons and Companies, and a carefully tied-up artillery plan.

Quite an amusing incident occurred when HQ first got into position. The Troop Leader, having a good look with his glasses, saw at the back of a cemetery on the high ground at the south eastern corner of the village what looked like  a towed 88mm with men moving round it. The range was about 3,000 yards, and he brewed it up third shot. When we went up there next morning, to our horror we found it was an outsize in biers with a long plank sticking out of it, perched up on the soil of an open grave below it.

Before this could be accomplished the pill box area had to be cleared up as this covered the hollow between the two ridges in which the Rifle Company were to be formed up. This area received a rapid shelling from the tanks, and 25 pounder smoke was put down across the south west corner of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#barum">Barum</a> to cover the tanks in. 4th Troop with the leading motor platoon put in a succesful attack, taking 25 prisoners, and leaving six or so dead enemy. The gun in the pill box had already been destroyed. The platoon withdrew leaving 4th Troop to hold the area. During this attack 3 guns towed by half-tracks were seen to be withdrawing from the village, and were all brewed up by the encircling squadrons. H Hour was decided on as 19.00 hours, and the fire plan was as follows. At H - 10 a heavy concentration of medium would open up on the forward or west edge of the village, and continue until H Hour. At H - 5 minutes until H + 5 minutes smoke would be put down by 25 pounders, also on the west edge of the village. At H to H + 8 minutes a Regiment of 25 pounders would fire on the forward edge of the village lifting to the middle and east part as required. The whole Company was to form up behind the small crest, and to advance, 1 platoon up at H our to within 200 yards of the village under cover of the smoke. At H + 8 minutes they were to advance and take the area of the cross roads, 865987 as their first objective. The Squadron was to thicken up the fire until H + 8 and to help with smoke should the screen begin to thin. 3rd and 4th Troops were ordered to advance at H + 6 and go through the infantry in order to be in the west edge of the village as the smoke lifted. Once in the village no difficulty was expected in mopping up. All went well - the gunners put down a first-class stonk and some very effective smoke, although this latter began to drift too soon, but the gaps were immediately filled up by the platoons and the tank troops' 2 inch mortars and the 95mms in Squadron HQ. The enemy tried to fight in the outskirts of the village but the sight of the tanks looming out of the smoke was too much, and after the 88 on the road was knocked out, the cross roads were soon taken.
