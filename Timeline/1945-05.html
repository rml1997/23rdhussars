00.01 hours. Just after midnight the 23rd Hussars/<acronym title="8th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade">8th RB</acronym> got off the road and prepared to leaguer for the night just north of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#schwarzenbek">Schwarzenbeck</a>. 1/100,000 Sheet L5.<br /><br />
We were then ordered to move on to give room for Main Brigade to come up behind and leaguer. "A" Squadron Group, followed by HQ and "B" Squadron moved up the secondary road towards
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#sahms">Sahms</a>, 8551. "C" Squadron Group moved up the main road 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#schwarzenbek">Schwarzenbeck</a> - 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#molln">Molln</a>, 9563. It was a dark night and progress was very slow. We moved at a snail's pace all night. At dawn as "A" Squadron Group approached 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#sahms">Sahms</a> the two leading tanks were knocked out by what were thought to be two Tigers but they were never definitely located. It was decided to put in a full scale Squadron/Company attack. "C" Squadron meanwhile, unable to move up the main road owing to mines and the blowing of the bridge at 845515, moved westwards and then north across country through
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#grove">Grove</a>, 8351 -   
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#lanken">Lanken</a>, 8453 -
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#elmenhorst">Elmenhorst</a>, 8553 with the object of striking the main road to the north of the block and continuing the advance. A small number of PWs were taken in these villages. As "C" Squadron Group approached the main road they were engaged by <acronym title="Armour Piercing">AP</acronym> fire from the area of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#kankelau">Kankelau</a>, 8854. Tanks were knocked out. "C" Group were then ordered to move into a position to attack
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#kankelau">Kankelau</a>. Meanwhile "A" Squadron Group attacked
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#sahms">Sahms</a> and approximately 60 PWs were taken. "B" Squadron were passed through to to work up to
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#kankelau">Kankelau</a> from the south but were unable to get on owing to marshes. 2nd Fife and Forfar Group had in the meantime moved up behind "C" Squadron and pushed on across country by tracks to 
Borstorf, 8761 - Koberg, 8564 and thence to Sirksfelde. They made good progress against no opposition.
<br /><br />
At approximately 15.00 hours "B" Squadron were ordered to advance west from
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#sahms">Sahms</a> up the main road via
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#talkau">Talkau</a> and road junction 897591 to
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#koberg">Koberg</a>, there to harbour for the night.
<br /><br />
There was a delay from mines which had been laid to cover the demolished bridge. There was also a large number of sea mines which had not been primed. The enemy had luckily not had time.
<br /><br />
18.00 hours. Eventually "B" Squadron went through followed by "A" and HQ  and got off the road in the area of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#talkau">Talkau</a>, 8857. Meanwhile "C" Squadron attacked
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#kankelau">Kankelau</a> and found one 105mm gun abandoned. Three others were reported to have pulled out. Theleading troop of "B" Squadron, when ordered to move on to the road junction, 897591, was fired on from the area Mendorf, 9058. They engaged the enemy and knocked out one A/Tank gun. It was then decided to turn off at road junction 885578 and thence to
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#borstorf">Borstorf</a>. The going was very bad. One of the leading tanks was bogged at approximately 873600. Efforts to bypass it and to pull it out were unsuccessful and the Regiment harboured for the night in situ by squadrons wherever it was possible to get out of the lanes.
<br /><br />
Four Other Ranks were killed in action and two wounded. One car, the MO's 8-cwt, a Steener - a captured vehicle - was abandoned at <acronym title="Map Reference">M.R.</acronym> 8302, Sheet M 54, 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#westerg">Westergellersen</a>, Province Hanover, owing to unserviceability and non-availability of spares. Three tanks, Comets, were destroyed by enemy action.

As the second class roads and trackes had been proved impassible, "C" Squadron Group was ordered to clear the road
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#talkau">Talkau</a> - road junction 918605 and thence west to 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#borstorf">Borstorf</a>. There was no opposition. Two large sea mines were exploded. They caused no damage to the tanks but blew two very large craters in the road. These were eventually filled in and "C" Squadron moved on.
<br /><br />
12.00 hours. 2nd F &amp; F Yeomanry were making good progress, finding no opposition, and the Brigade was directed onto
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#lubeck">Lubeck</a>. 23rd Hussar Group, having taken some time to extricate itself, followed behind 2nd F &amp; F Yeomanry via
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#sirksfelde">Sirksfelde</a>, 8367 -
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#steinhorst">Steinhorst</a>, 8374 -
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#westerau">Westerau</a>, 8279 and thence along the autobahn. 2nd F &amp; F Yeomanry had raced ahead and entered
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#lubeck">Lubeck</a>. They found little opposition.  23rd Hussar Group halted for a short while on the autobahn and was then ordered to bypass
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#lubeck">Lubeck</a> and push on to the coast. A large number of Allied POW were set free, including some British. "C" Squadron were put down in the area 9695, "B" and HQ, 9895, and "A" Squadron, the area 0295. An increasing number of prisoners was taken during the day. Opposition had now ceased. The enemy's one idea was to surrender without delay. Counting them was out of the question. It was difficult enough to herd them together.

"B" Squadron Group was ordered to move up and investigate
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#travemunde">Travemunde</a>. The enemy was surrendering in thousands. Captain
<a href="../Men/Weiner_JM_hq.html">Weiner</a> negotiated the surrender of airfield on the peninsular by telephone and then went across the river to take over. The water-ferry was still working. He went over in a Scout car. Germans poured onto the narrow neck of land trying to cross to escape from the Russians, who they thought were coming up in their rear. "C" Squadron Group was sent to
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#neustadt">Neustadt</a>. The main road was blocked but they bypassed to the east.
In 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#neustadt">Neustadt</a> great confusion reigned. Two ships full of Baltic <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> had just been shot up by the RAF and many were killed. Those who escaped were in very poor condition, and largely without clothes. Their condition was reported as reminiscent of that of the inmates of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#belsen">Belsen</a>. Higher authority was inclined to doubt it but they were later convinced.

<h3>APPENDIX TO 23rd HUSSARS WAR DIARY FOR MAY 1945</h3>

<h4>Germany, May 11th to 31st, 1945</h4>
<p>Although many changes were made in the original orders, the appointment of <acronym title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</acronym> 23rd Hussars as <acronym title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</acronym> Kreis Husum remained firm. At the same time, 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry were to take over the northern half of the Kreis, based on 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#bredstedt">Bredstedt</a>, 9080.
</p>
<p>A small advance party went 24 hours ahead only to find Brigade HQ wanting to move into the 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_barracks">Marine Barracks</a> and units of 7th Armoured Division having designs on the town. After ad hoc negotiations both the former and the latter went to 23rd Hussars, "B" Squadron, "C" Squadron and HQ going to the very excellent <a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_barracks">Marine School Barracks</a> lying on the north east corner of 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum">Husum</a> and "A" Squadron going to
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#hockensbull">Hockensbull</a> wireless station, 9266.</p>
</p>
<p>However, the innocent looking town and Kreis of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum">Husum</a>, instead of providing easy fruits of victory, was choked with some of the thorniest problems of Occupation. Quite apart from civilian problems, which were taken over by 930 Military Government Detachment with some delay and very inadequate staff, the situation as it developed during the month of May may be put under the two main heads: German PW and PWX/DP.
</p>

<h4>A. GERMAN PW</h4>
<p>A large German HQ - Seekommandant, Nordfriesland - was found permanently established in the town in control of all Naval, Army and Airforce establishments from the Danish Frontier, including Sylt, to the Kiel Canal, to a depth of 20 miles inland. This HQ, which fortunately had all the food dumps under its control, was at once confirmed in its authority and a "stay put" order to all Wehrmacht personnel was given. Within a few days it transpired - no direct orders were given - that all German PW troops were to be concentrated on to the adjoining peninsular of Eiderstedt as part of a concentration area "G". After conferences with 7th Armoured Division arrangements for transit were made and it became known that over 250,000 PW were expected to pass through from Denmark. The German commander was ordered to divide the Kreis into five districts with a Transit HQ and camps and billeting areas. A German Military Police Force of 450 was set up. At the same time the food dumps were brought under direct control and ration scales considerably reduced, luxury articles being withdrawn for use by PWX and <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym>.
</p>
<p>Within a week of arrival German PW were passing through the Kreis at a rate of 10,000-15,000 daily - a rate which lasted with some variations for over one month. As many troops had to come long distances on foot, provision had to be made for staging and for rapid onward transmission. This was done by running a daily train, carrying up to 2,000, a practice which was stopped by Higher Authority on being discovered!
</p>
<p>Apart from the control of the passage of German Troops and of PW movements, the main preoccupation was the disarmament of German Troops in the area, which included Naval establishments ashore and afloat. At the end of May the <a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_misc">Kreis dump</a> included 10,700 rifles, 440 machine guns, three 6 inch guns and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition.
</p>
<p>Other problems included the actual control of Luftwaffe personnel under nominal RAF control, camps where Nazi practices continued being discovered in the process - the collection of German servicewomen and the segregation of SS. In all these things the full co-operation of the German Commander was forthcoming.
</p>

<h4>B. PWX/DP</h4>
<p>Throughout the fighting in Germany, units could happily ignore the many thousands of ex-prisoners of war and foreigners whom they liberated, who often streamed back along the Centre-Line. But on arrival in their Kreis of Occupation the twin problems of PWX and <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym> confronted them in their full urgency, nor was any help possible or forthcoming from an inadequate and understaffed Military Government.
</p>
<p>On taking over the following main groups of PWX were at once uncovered: French 850, Poles 1,400, Russians 1,800, Italians 500.
</p>
<p><acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> numbered: French 50, Poles 800, Russians 1,800, Balts 980. Not to speak of innumerable smaller groups of other nationalities.
</p>
<p>In view of the size of some of these groups, and in view of the fact that they all had to be handled by 23rd Hussars, no separate Military Government team arriving until July, it was decided where necessary to drop the distinction between PWX and <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym> and to administer them jointly.
</p>
<p>Fortunately, some ten hutted camps odf various capacity were in the area, though one or two and necessarily to remain German for Transit purposes. Other camps were in a poor state of repair and almost devoid of stores. As elsewhere thers was an overall shortage of clothing and other necessities, although the unit was fortunate in taking over large stocks of some items in the <a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_barracks">Marine Barracks</a>.
</p>
<p>Within a few days, three small hutted camps, accommodating an average of 300 had been taken over for the French. These were evacuated to France at the end of the month.
</p>
<p>Simultaneously the village of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index,html#ahrenviol">Ahrenviol</a>, 0468 was taken over complete, the German population being removed in its entirety. The same was done by 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry at 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#hogel">Hogel</a>, 9782. All Russian <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> and as many PWX as possible were concentrated into these two villages, the former housing 2,200, and the latter 1,400, many Russians having come from outside the Kreis at the news of these good tidings. All surplus PWX, numbering 900, were concentrated in two hutted camps. Before being accepted into the villages or the camps all arrivals were bathed and de-loused and issued with new clothing as long as stocks lasted.
</p>
<p>Finally Polish PWX who were found in an atrocious condition in a former concentration camp were evacuated, so that they and the camp might be cleaned and put in order. 900 were put back into this camp whilst 300 went to a smaller hutted camp, 200 remaining on their farms in the <acronym title="2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry">2nd F. &amp; F.</acronym> area. Polish <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> were left to a later date until the Russians had beenevacuated. The same was done with Baltics, whilst the concentration of Italians did not take place until after the evacuation of the French.
</p>
<p>As no satisfactory arrangement could be made with Military Government, food and supplies were obtained in bulk from the German Military Depot and issued equally to PWX and <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym>. This continued until the 22nd May, 1945 when the <acronym title="Royal Army Service Corps">R.A.S.C.</acronym> issued to units in bulk. The average daily issue from the unit during the month of May was 5,500. These rations, which were monotonous in the extreme, were supplemented by local requisitions of milk and butter.
</p>
<p>The question of Public Order was always predominant, it being hard to strike a balance between the plausible claim of "just revenge" and considerations of public safety. Some camps were run by British personnel provided by the unit, whilst the village of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index,html#ahrenviol">Ahrenviol</a> was entirely administered by a complete troop from "B" Squadron, the officers acting as Burgomaster, ably assisted by his "Sergeant - Grocer". A section of 18th Light Field Ambulance set up a hospital, delousing and sanitation being done by German Field Hygiene Section.

<h4>SUMMARY</h4>
<p>The month of May, which had brought V.E. Day, was therefore filled with much hard work and very little play. Soft vehicles were employed to capacity in shifting PWX/<acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym> and supplies. Tanks were being worked on for storage, etc. Much work had to be done in cleaning the
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_barracks">Barracks</a> and getting them into shape and during this, SS labour was employed. This included other personalities: Goering's brother-in-law, the deputy Gauleiter of East Prussia and the Clothing Storekeeper of Dachau Concentration Camp!! Guards had to be provided for PWX and 
<acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym> camps, for an SS hospital, for road blocks, posts on area "G" boundary, etc.
</p>
<p>At the end of the month, however, a holiday camp was established at a salubrious hotel on 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#fohr">Fohr Island</a>, and the first party of 60 was sent on the last weekend. This proved a great and well deserved success.
