In the beginning of the month the large flow of Germans had definitely ceased and German District HQs and Transit Camps were reduced to a skeleton scale. The Police Troop was reduced to approximately 200 and all remaining units accordingly. By the end of the month the following personnel remained in the Kreis:-
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>Under German Kreis Command - 457</li>
<li>Hospital Staffs under <acronym title="Senior Medical Officer">S.M.O.</acronym> - 248</li>
<li>Engineer Units under C.R.E - 189</li>
<li>Luftwaffe Units frozen under RAF - 673</li>
<li>Patients under treatment - 985</li>
<li><acronym title="Reichsarbeitsdienst - Labour Service of the Third Reich">R.A.D.</acronym> - 351</li>
<li>Service Women - 185</li>
</ul>
Undischarged personnel working in civilian jobs numbered 560. During the month orders came for the discharge of personnel under operation "Blimp" and nominal rolls and the necessary preparations were made.
<br /><br />
On the 30th all undischarged personnel in the Kreis living in 8th Corps District, outside Kries Husum, were despatched to their home Kreise. These numbered some 350. During the month also many service women passed out of the Kreis for discharge at 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#rendsburg">Rendsburg</a>. <acronym title="Reichsarbeitsdienst - Labour Service of the Third Reich">R.A.D.</acronym>, the majority of whom lived in the Russian Zone, remained behind to work on the land and as maintenance and repair parties for PWX/<acronym title="Displaced Person">DP</acronym> Camps.

The Russians having been despatched at the end of June, only three large camps of foreign nationalities remained in the Kreis: 500 Italian PWX, 1,250 Polish PWX, 800 Polish <acronym title="Displaced Person">DPs</acronym> and 980 Balts. To these can be added 168 Serb PWX. Of these the Italians were already housed in two hutted camps and the Poles in one camp containing 200 and another containg 350. Both of these groups were providing 60 PWX Guards each to man Area "G" stop line. In the second week of July the group of 900 Polish PWX was transferred to Sylt.
<br /><br />
July 20th The same camp was used for 900 Polish PWX in transit from Flensburg to Eckenforde. These remained for ten days. This camp then became vacant ad was cleaned. Italian PWX remained throughout the month. Serb PWX remained scattered on their farms.
<br /><br />
At the beginning of July an <acronym title="United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration">UNRRA</acronym> team, hotly pursued by 40 DP.A.C. arrived. It was their intention gradually to take over the feeding administration, welfare and discipline of all <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> of whom the Balts remained entirely unorganised. In the first week of the month all Polish <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> in the Kreis area were taken to 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#hogel">Hogel</a> village. At the same time 1,100 Polish <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> were brought to 
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#ahrenviol">Ahrenviol</a> from outside the Kreis. Over 250 Balts also established themselves there.
<br /><br />
July 20th Feeding of <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> was taken over by 40 DP.A.C. and <acronym title="Royal Army Service Corps">R.A.S.C.</acronym> supplies ceased. Registration and welfare was also taken over but administration and discipline had still to be carried on by a Troop in each village. Looting and slaughtering of cattle took place on a large scale in the vicinity of each village, and only the most active patrolling and vigilance, combined with exhortations and appeals, managed to reduce these crimes by the end of the month. At the same time it was found that the administration of each village could not be left to the Poles themselves without violent dissension. This therefore was also continued in the case of
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#ahrenviol">Ahrenviol</a> by Captain <a href="../Men/Vickers_GV_b.html">Vickers</a> and Troops of "B" Squadron.
<br /><br />
Throughout the month 71,000 <acronym title="Royal Army Service Corps">R.A.S.C.</acronym> rations were distributed by the unit to PWX and <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DP</acronym>. At the same time repairs, etc., to camps were undertaken through a German Naval Office of Works.

The chief military activities consisted of lorried patrols in the Kreis, which was divided into squadron areas, each supplemented by snap checks and road blocks. at the same time the two British posts on the northern exits from area "G" were permanently manned. These continued to be linked up by Polish and Italian PWX and patrols along the whole length of the northern boundary from
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum">Husum</a> to
Rantrum, 9752. Although some two dozen German PW were caught trying to slip out the chief offenders were civilians and great difficulty was experienced in ensuring a satisfactory system of Military Government passes. At the end of the month orders were received for the despatch of all our Comet Tanks, and these were prepared for delivery on August 3rd. Three Subaltern Officers and four NCOs left on our first SEAC postings.
<br /><br />
A Regimental Sports Meeting was held on the Barracks Sports Ground with great success on July 12th, at which "C" Squadron won with ease. Brigadier C.B. Harvey, DSO, gave away the prizes. The
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum_misc">Swimming Pool</a> was opened on the same occasion with a Regimental "plunge". A number of cricket matches against other units were played. Holiday parties of 40 each continued to visit <a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#fohr">Fohr Island</a>, whilst Major <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">C.H. Blacker</a>, MC, visited Marseilles as member of a British Military Team in a Horse Race against French, American and Russians. From 16th July the Regiment was commanded by Major <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">C.H. Blacker</a>, MC, during the absence of Lieut/Colonel <a href="../Men/Harding_RP_x.html">R.P. Harding</a>, DSO, as Acting Brigadier, 29th Armoured Brigade.
