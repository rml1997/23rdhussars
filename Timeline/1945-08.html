Of these 300 Polish PWX remained concentrated in one camp at Wittbeck, 0362, providing weekly 60 men for posts and patrols on Area "G" boundary. The remainder being <acronym title="Displaced Persons">DPs</acronym> were now chiefly the responsibility of 243 <acronym title="United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration">UNRRA</acronym> Team and 133 Relief Section FAU. All of 1,800 Poles being housed in the two villages of

Throughout the month detachments of <acronym title="2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry">2nd F &amp; F</acronym> Yeomanry and 23rd Hussars were kept in each of the villages to supervise feeding and administration.

The chief military activities consisted of lorried patrols, largely by night, in the Kreis, which was divided into squadron areas, each supplemented by snap checks and road blocks. at the same time three British posts on the northern exits from area "G" were permanently manned. These were continued southward by a line of Polish posts as far as Rantrum, 9752. Although some German PW were caught trying to slip out the chief offenders were civilians.
<br /><br />
On August 3rd our Comet tanks began to leave and the Regiment was re-organised on a dismounted basis with two rifle troops and one Mobile troop as the fighting component of each squadron.
<br /><br />
16 Other Ranks left on SEAC postings whilst 3 were demobilised. A number of cricket matches against other units were played and the Regimental Sports Team embarked on a programme of serious training in preparation for the Brigade Sports in September. Holiday parties of 40 each continued to visit
