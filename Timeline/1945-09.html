The major event in the life of the Regiment consisted in the loss of Lieut/Colonel <a href="../Men/Harding_RP_x.html">R.P. Harding</a>, DSO, who had commanded in training and battle for 4 years and to whose popular and efficient command the successes of the unit had largely been due. He was fortunately succeeded by the Second-in-Comand, Major <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">C.H. Blacker</a>, MC, on September 30th.
<br /><br />
The chief military activities continued in the form of lorried patrols, snap checks and road blocks. The manning of Area "G" boundary continued.
<br /><br />
The Brigade Sports Meeting took place on September 17th on the Regimental Sports Foeld and was won by the Regiment after a close tussle with the <acronym title="8th Battalion, the Rifle Brigade">8th RB</acronym>. Holiday parties of 40 each continued to visit
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#fohr">Fohr Island</a> until the middle of the month.
