The first major changes of personnel took place through release and the exchange of high age for age groups under thirty. 18 All ranks were released, four under Class B. Included in theses was Major <a href="../Men/Wigan_AD_a_b.html">A.D. Wigan</a>, MC, who had trained and fought with the Regiment for four years and he was replaced as <acronym title="Officer Commanding">O.C.</acronym> "B" Squadron by Captain <a href="../Men/Walter_PC_c_b.html">P.C. Walter</a>, DSO, who had been wounded at Caen. 94 All Ranks were posted all told, the majority to 7th Armoured Division; 22 to the 8th Hussars, 17 to 5th Dragoon Guards and 39 to 1st <acronym title="Royal Tank Regiment">RTR</acronym>. Included in these postings were the majority of high age group subalterns. In exchange, 102 Other Ranks arrived during the period. This exchange took place at the end of the month and before Lieut Colonel <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">C.H. Blacker</a>, MC, addressed all ranks on the final occasion of their being all together as the 23rd Hussars.
<br /><br />
At the beginning of the month "Area G" was abandoned and guards withdrawn from the boundary line. Lorried patrols, snap checks and road blocks were continued. Sports were vigorously performed. Football matches against other units were played often twice weekly. A Gymnkhana was held near
<a href="../Gallery/Ger/index.html#husum">Husum</a> and proved a great success. 29th Armoured Brigade provided the winning team with one entry from this Regiment.
<br /><br />
At the end of the month Lieut Colonel <a href="../Men/Blacker_CH_c.html">C.H. Blacker</a>, MC, went to Paris as a member of the British Team in an International Race at Aubeuil.
<br /><br />
Among all the entertainments provided for troops, Squadron Canteen Nights very often proved the most popular.
